# DESCRIPTION
COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS NAME: PELLURU SAI INTERN ID:CT12VCC DOMAIN: SQL DURATION: 8 WEEKS MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR

Editor Platform:MySql and Postgresql

This Task focuses on migrating data from MySQL to PostgreSQL, ensuring data integrity and compatibility between the two databases. The process involves exporting data from MySQL, transforming it to fit PostgreSQL's syntax, and importing it into the target database.

Key Steps in the Migration Process:
Export Data from MySQL – Using mysqldump or SELECT INTO OUTFILE to extract data in a PostgreSQL-compatible format.
Data Transformation – Adjusting MySQL-specific syntax (e.g., AUTO_INCREMENT to SERIAL, backticks to double quotes, removing ENGINE=InnoDB).
Import into PostgreSQL – Using psql or tools like pgloader for seamless data transfer.
Data Verification – Ensuring data integrity, checking for missing records, and validating constraints.
Applicability:
This migration process is essential for organizations transitioning from MySQL to PostgreSQL for better scalability, open-source compatibility, or advanced SQL features. The knowledge gained is useful for database administrators (DBAs), data engineers, and cloud engineers working with relational databases.
